# Hybrid SVR Models for Reference Evapotranspiration (ET‚ÇÄ) Estimation

This repository contains Python implementations of hybrid machine learning models for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET‚ÇÄ) using Support Vector Regression (SVR) optimized with two metaheuristic algorithms:

- **SVR-CMAES**: Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
- **SVR-GSA**: Gravitational Search Algorithm

The models are evaluated using multiple input configurations, and both sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed to assess model robustness and variable influence.

## üß† Model Overview

The following hybrid SVR models are implemented:

- `SVR-GSA`: Combines Support Vector Regression with the Gravitational Search Algorithm
- `SVR-CMAES`: Combines Support Vector Regression with the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy

Each model is evaluated with the following **input configurations**:

| Configuration | Input Variables |
|---------------|------------------|
| C1 | Temperature only |
| C2 | Temperature + Solar Radiation |
| C3 | Temperature + Solar Radiation + Wind Speed |
| C4 | Temperature + Solar Radiation + Wind Speed + Relative Humidity |

## üìä Sensitivity Analysis

Two types of sensitivity analysis are conducted to evaluate the influence of input variables:

- **Local Sensitivity Analysis (LSA)**: One-at-a-time (OAT) method
- **Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)**: Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (eFAST)

---

## üéØ Uncertainty Analysis

- **Bootstrap Resampling** is used to assess the uncertainty in ET‚ÇÄ estimations from SVR-GSA and SVR-CMAES models.

---

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is assessed using the following statistical metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
- **Coefficient of Determination (R¬≤)**
- **Global Performance Indicator (GPI)**
- **Willmott‚Äôs Modified Index of Agreement (d1)**
- **Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE)**
